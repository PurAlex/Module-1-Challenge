# Module-1-Challenge

## Description

This project was created to improve the **accesibility** of the website, so it is easier for other developers to know what the code do.

This is what I refactored of the existing code.

* Semantic HTML.
* HTML and CSS now follows a logical structure.
* All the images contain **alt** attributes.
* Headings attributes are in sequential order.
* Title elements contain a descriptive title.
* Comments to every tag of the code in HTML and CSS.
